# About Me

Hi, I’m a **passionate Embedded Systems Engineer** with over **7 years of experience** working with **production-grade Linux** (Android, Yocto, Debian) for **Embedded Systems**, **Consumer Electronics**, and **IoT devices**. I have a deep understanding of **ARM CPU architecture**, **bootloaders**, and **hardware protocols** like **USB**, **PCIe**, **UART**, **I2C**, **SPI**, and **GPIO**.

In my career, I’ve been involved in developing and maintaining **OS images** (Yocto, AOSP, Debian), managing **packaging and release methodology**, and ensuring **CVEs tracking and fixing** for product security. My expertise also includes **CI/CD** pipelines, ensuring continuous integration and automated testing for high-quality software releases.

I'm also keenly interested in the development of **cyber-physical systems** to meet real-world needs, which drives me to stay updated on the latest advancements in the field. Currently, I am exploring opportunities that require a background in **quantitative analytics**, **data modeling**, and **machine learning**, with an emphasis on **Big Data frameworks** like **Cassandra**, **Hadoop**, and **Spark**.

## Key Expertise

- **Embedded Systems**: Extensive experience in developing firmware/software for embedded platforms with a strong focus on **ARM SoCs**, particularly **Qualcomm** SoCs.
- **Linux Systems**: Production-grade experience with Linux (Android/Yocto/Debian), including OS image generation and system maintenance.
- **Protocols & Bootloaders**: Expert in hardware protocols and bootloaders like **U-Boot**, **GRUB**, and **UEFI**.
- **CI/CD & Testing**: Strong skills in building and maintaining continuous integration pipelines for consistent software development.
- **Wireless Technologies**: Knowledge of **Bluetooth** and **wireless protocols**, including hands-on work with **STM32**, **nRF Connect SDK**, and **Zephyr RTOS**.
- **Rust Enthusiast**: Currently learning **Rust** through the **rustlings** repository and expanding my skill set in modern, systems-level programming.

## Professional Goals

I’m currently seeking to contribute to projects that intersect embedded systems and machine learning, while also looking to **contribute to the Linux kernel** and further my understanding of **open-source development**. Additionally, I’m interested in **firmware development** with **Zephyr RTOS** and **Bluetooth technologies**.
